# Auto-GPTweeter: Turning AutoGPT Into a Twitter User

# ‚õîÔ∏è WARNING ‚õîÔ∏è
Please, for the love of god, run this in a docker container or some other VM. Make sure your home network is secure. Sandbox this as much as you can. If you don't care about what happens to your machine or network, more power to you, but you're giving randoms on the internet the ability to interact with an AutoGPT instance running on a device you control. That's literally giving them the ability to remotely execute code on your machine, so expect to restore the image frequently.
